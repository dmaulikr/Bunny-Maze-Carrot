Bunny-Maze-Carrot
=================

A relatively small C++ program with a working implementation of a few algorithms (though main only runs 1 of them).
This program calculates the shortest path from a start location (the bunny) to an end location (the carrot). I used it for a second year project. Totally NAILED IT btw :D
